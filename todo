** Dashboard **
- Show how many complete by month
- show docs by county

** Data entry **
- When I get to a TSN that seems like a repeat of one that I did last month:
    - Need to be able to search on the name or address 
    - Need to copy the data to the new document... or something
- Be able to edit values in data entry for the current document
- Automatically detect duplicated: turn document into text, then search the words for matches in old docs. Then pull up the old document if it's a foreclosure on the same house.
- When user enters borrower name, check old docs to see if there is a match.
- When user enters a subdivision with an apostrophe, it won't save in mysql
- prepopulate owner mailing 1 as same as property by default
- After user enters Cad link, use it to get the property address
- Add a field for estimated equity. Not a user input. This will self calculate based on the DOT date and original mortgage amount.
- Don't allow addresses without line break
- Field for link to deed of trust
- Status for skip document but come back to it later
- Mark pages to skip in trustee sale notices (like if one is blank except for clerk stamp or something)
- Allow user to filter for complete, incomplete, and skip
- Email and phone number fields
- Check again which fields really need multi line input boxes
- Show progress meter aka how many blanks do I have left to go?


** Mail merge **
- add commas to numbers
- Order by equity highest to lowest, but put condo foreclosures at the end
- Filter by amount of equity, i.e. which ones go priorty mail vs snail mail
- Show the estimated equity in mail merge page

- How much time does it take to query db for one doc at a time in a loop vs. one query for many docs at once? (re. mail merge)


** RESPONSES **
